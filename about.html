        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>This blog is for anyone who loves to cook and for everyone who doesn’t.</p>

        <p>
            I love to cook, but I haven’t always.  
            I also post lots of food photos and stories on my  <a href="https://instagram.com/vishwa_rock07?igshid=NzZlODBkYWE4Ng==" >Instagram</a>
        </p>
        <p>Here are <b>four</b> reasons I think you’ll love my blog, whether you’re a seasoned chef or just starting out:
        </p>
            
        <p><b>Great recipes:</b>. It’s a food blog, so naturally you’re going to find recipes here. But I only share the recipes I really, truly love. You won’t find anything here that I’ve never made before or would never make again. 
            Every recipe I post has my stamp of approval—if I wouldn’t eat it or serve it, you won’t find it here.
        
        </p>

        <p>    <b>Helpful tips and techniques:</b> I love learning any skill that helps me get the job done faster, easier or with a better result. 
                That’s why I created a page of nothing but useful tips and techniques.
        </p>
            
        <p><b>Fun:</b> Food and fun come together in this blog because everything about food 
            should be fun, eating it, making it and even making a mess of it.
        </p>
            
        <p><b>Bloopers:</b> Let’s face it – sometimes cooking just doesn’t go as planned. Don’t let that discourage you, though. Look at my mistakes, learn from them and laugh along with me. It’s just food…
            if it doesn’t turn out, salvage what you can, toss the rest and just try again next time.
