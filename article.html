        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the fettuccine pasta according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and black pepper. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until it's no longer pink in the center, about 6-7 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and slice it into thin strips.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute, until fragrant. Stir in the heavy cream and butter. Bring to a simmer and let it cook for 2-3 minutes, until the butter has melted and the sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li>Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until the sauce is smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Return the sliced chicken to the skillet and simmer for another 2-3 minutes, until the chicken is heated through and the sauce is thickened.</li>
            <li>Season the sauce with more salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve the chicken Alfredo sauce over the cooked fettuccine pasta. Garnish with fresh parsley and extra Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
        </ol>
